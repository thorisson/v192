title: The Future of AI Research: Ten Defeasible ‘Axioms of Intelligence’
abstract: What sets artificial intelligence (AI) apart from other fields of science
  and technology is <b><i>not</i></b> what it has achieved so far, but rather
  what it set out to do from the very beginning, namely, <i>to create autonomous
  self-contained systems that can rival human cognition</i>—machines with ‘human-level
  general intelligence.’ To achieve this aim calls for a new <i>kind</i> of system
  that, among other things, unifies – in a single architecture – the ability to represent
  causal relations, create and manage knowledge incrementally and autonomously, and
  generate its own meaning through empirical reasoning and control. We maintain that
  building such systems requires a shared methodological foundation, and calls for
  a stronger theoretical basis than simply the one inherited directly from computer
  science. This, in turn, calls for a greater emphasis on the theory of intelligence
  and methodological approaches for building such systems. We argue that necessary
  (but not necessarily sufficient) components for general intelligence must include
  the unification of causal relations, reasoning, and cognitive development. A constructivist
  stance, in our view, can serve as a good starting point for this purpose.
