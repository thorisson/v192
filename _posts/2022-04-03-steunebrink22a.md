title: 'The Holon System: Artificial General Intelligence as ‘Work on Command’'
abstract: Recent interest in the ‘Large Language Models’ of deep learning has led
  to widespread conjecture that artificial general intelligence (AGI) is thereby imminent. At
  the other end of the spectrum, it has also been claimed that ‘general’ intelligence
  cannot exist at all. In this extended abstract, we argue that both of these perspectives
  are misconceived. We provide a pragmatic definition of general intelligence, grounded
  in fundamental business and engineering requirements. We explain why a ‘deployed
  regression model’ (such as deep learning) cannot meet this criterion for <i>generality</i>
  of intelligence. We then proceed to describe the Holon system, designed and implemented
  to meet this criterion.
