title: Novel Primitive Decompositions for Real-World Physical Reasoning
abstract: In this work, we are concerned with developing cognitive representations
  that may enhance the ability for self-supervised learning systems to learn language
  as part of their world explorations. We apply insights from in-depth language understanding
  systems to the problem, specifically representations which decompose language inputs
  into language-free structures that are complex combinations of primitives representing
  cognitive abstractions such as object permanence, movement, and spatial relationships. These
  decompositions, performed by a system traditionally called a <i>conceptual
  analyzer</i>, link words with complex non-linguistic structures that engender the rich
  relations between language expressions and world exploration that are a familiar
  aspect of intelligence. We focus on improving and extending both the Conceptual
  Dependency (CD) representation system, its primitive decompositions, and its conceptual
  analyzer, choosing as our corpus the ProPara (“Process Paragraphs”) dataset, which
  consists of paragraphs describing biological, chemical, and physical processes of
  the kind that appear in grade-school science textbooks (e.g., photosynthesis, erosion). In
  doing so, we avoid the significant challenges of decomposing concepts involving
  communication, thought, and complex social interactions. To meet the challenges
  of this dataset, we contribute a <i>mental motion pictures</i> representation
  system with  important innovations, such as using image schemas in place of CD primitives
  and decoupling containment relationships into separate primitives.
