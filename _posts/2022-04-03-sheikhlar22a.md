title: Explicit General Analogy for Autonomous Transversal Learning
abstract: Making analogies is a kind of reasoning where two or more things are compared,
  to highlight or uncover attributes of interest. Besides being useful for comparing
  what is known, analogy making can help a learning agent deal with tasks and environments
  not experienced before, where similarities and differences to known phenomena and
  their cause-effects relations can be a source for generating hypotheses about novel
  phenomena, which in turn can serve as a basis for exploration and experimentation. Artificial
  intelligence (AI) systems that can make use of explicit analogies are relatively
  rare, and those making general analogies are even rarer. This may be because most
  AI systems are targeted to well-known tasks, relying heavily on human programmers
  for knowledge creation, an approach that – besides being intractably slow, error-prone,
  and highly ineffective – precludes the use of analogies for enabling autonomous
  knowledge transfer between tasks, domains, and environments with common characteristics. The
  automation of explicit analogy making in the service of such knowledge transfer
  has, in our view, at least three prerequisites: (a) Compositional knowledge representation,
  (b) reasoning machinery, and (c) the ability of the agent to make experiments on
  its surroundings. For an agent’s intelligence to be general, the methods chosen
  for these must be domain-independent and available on-demand at the agent’s discretion. The
  agent would identify a target novelty, generate hypotheses about what the novelty
  is ‘like’ through analogies, generate a set of hypotheses with potential to disqualify
  these and select between competing hypotheses, and intervene on the environment
  through direct action to test them. Here we describe the design of an analogy mechanism
  that allows a learning agent with the above features to autonomously, using previously-learned
  causal knowledge, make analogies between a source and target task, hypothesize sets
  of new causal models for performing the new tasks, and to verify the validity of
  these through a set of autonomously generated actions. We describe how this general
  approach can be implemented in an existing cognitive system, the Autocatlytic Endogenous
  Reflective Architecture (AERA).
